To do:
background: wikipedia link, population dynamics, n-cycles (including
    r-values of boundaries which separate them), chaos
json: anything else needed?
svg:
summary of inputs: r, n (= nMax - nMin), yInitial
additional instructions:
    toggle lines' visibility (and horiz lines for n-cycles?)
    The size is optimized for Chrome's mid-magnification on my MacBookPro.
optimize the dot radius (calculate min distance between dots, and use accordingly?)
control lines' visibility with a toggle
