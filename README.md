To do:
slash route: include r-values of boundaries?
json: anything else needed?
svg:
1) summary of inputs: r, n (= nMax - nMin), yInitial
2) additional instructions:
    toggle lines' visibility (and horiz lines for n-cycles?)
    The size is optimized for Chrome's mid-magnification on my MacBookPro.
3) optimize the dot radius (calculate min distance between dots, and use accordingly?)
4) control lines' visibility with a toggle
