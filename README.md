To do:
slash route: include r-values of boundaries or r-dep trajectories of cycles?
json: anything else needed?
svg:
1) control lines' visibility attribute as either "hidden" or "visible"
2) additional instructions:
    toggle lines' visibility (and horiz lines for n-cycles?)
3) optimize the dot radius (calculate min distance between dots, and use accordingly?)
