To do:
slash route background and instructions
background: wikipedia link, population dynamics, n-cycles (including
    r-values of boundaries which separate them), chaos
instructions:
    choose either json or svg
    inputs: 0 <= r <= 4, nMax, yInitial [|| Math.random()], nMin (|| 0)
json: anything else needed?
svg:
summary of inputs: r, n (= nMax - nMin), yInitial
additional instructions:
    toggle lines' visibility (and horiz lines for n-cycles?)
    The size is optimized for Chrome's mid-magnification on my MacBookPro.
optimize the dot radius (calculate min distance between dots, and use accordingly?)
connect lines by dots, and control their visibility with a toggle
